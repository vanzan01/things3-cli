## things add [OPTIONS] [--] [-|TITLE]

Adds new todos to Things.

If `-` is given as a title, it is read from STDIN. When titles have multiple
lines of text, the first is set as the todo's title and the remaining lines
are set as the todo's notes. Notes set this way take precedence over the
`--notes=` option.

**OPTIONS**

*--canceled*, *--cancelled*
   Whether or not the todo should be set to canceled. Default: false. Takes
   priority over completed.

*--notes*
  The text to use for the notes field of the todo. Maximum unencoded
  length: 10,000 characters.

  todo in the database. Ignored if the date is in the future.

  multiple todos have been created, the first one will be shown. Ignored
  if show-quick-entry is also set to true. Default: false.

*--tags=TAG1[,TAG2,TAG3...]*
  Comma separated strings corresponding to the titles of tags. Does not
  apply a tag if the specified tag doesn't exist.

*--when=DATE|DATETIME*
  Possible values: today, tomorrow, evening, anytime, someday, a date
  string, or a date time string. Using a date time string adds a reminder
  for that time. The time component is ignored if anytime or someday is
  specified.

*--titles=TITLE1[,TITLE2,TITLE3...]*
  Use instead of title to create multiple todos. Takes priority over title
  and show-quick-entry. The other parameters are applied to all the
  created todos.

  replacing them), replace-notes, or replace-checklist-items (newlines
